# Kafka Metrics

This is a system for real-time aggregation of metrics from large distributed systems. Rather than replacing existing 
monitoring solutions it fulfills the role of `real-time distributed aggregation` element to combine metrics from 
multiple systems, with some out-of-the-box features for data streams pipelines based on Apache Kafka.

## Overview
</a>

Kafka Metrics is a set of libraries and runtime modules that can be deployed in various configurations and can be used 
as an **A)** out-of-the-box monitoring for data streams infrastructures built with Apache Kafka including automatic discovery
 and configuration for existing Kafka clusters **B)** a framework for monitoring distributed systems in general using Apache Kafka infrastructure as a transport layer.

The aim of the design is to have small composable modules that can be deployed by configuration to cover use cases ranging 
from quick, non-intrusive inspection of existing Kafka clusters and stream pipelines, to massive-scale purpose-built 
monitoring, detection and alerting infrastructure for distributed systems in general.

It uses InfluxDB as the time series back-end and comes with, but is not limited to Grafana front-end and Kapactior
alerting on top of that.

![overview](doc/metrics.png)

There are several ways of how the aggregation of metrics is achieved using one or more modules.  

<a name="scenario0">
### Basic Scenario
</a>

For smaller systems consisting of components on the same network or simply a localhost, direct JMX scanner tasks can be 
configured for each JMX Application. This method doesn't require to include any extra code in the monitored applications 
as long as they already expose JMX MBeans and in a local environment the kafka topic can also be omitted.

![scenario0](doc/kafka-metrics-scenario0.png)

<a name="scenario1">
### Multi-Server Scenario
</a>

For bigger systems, where metrics from several hosts need to be aggregated or in cases where more fault-tolerant 
collection of metrics is required, a combination of pluggable TopicReproter or JMX Metrics Agent and a Kafka Topic can 
be deployed by configuration. The JMX Scanner used in the basic scenario is replaced with InfluxDB Loader which is a 
kafka consumer that reads measurements from the metrics topic and writes them into the InfluxDB.


![scenario1](doc/kafka-metrics-scenario1.png)

<a name="scenario2">
### Multi-Data-Centre Scenario
</a>

For multi-DC, potentially global deployments, where metrics from several disparate clusters need to be collected, each 
cluster has its agent which publishes into a local metrics topic and one of the existing mirroring components 
(Kafka Prism, Kafka Mirror Maker, ...) is deployed to aggregate local metrics topic into a single aggregated stream 
providing a real-time monitoring of the entire system.

![scenario2](doc/kafka-metrics-scenario2.png)

<a name="scenario3">
### Multi-Environment Scenario
</a>

Finally, in the heterogeneous environments, where different kinds of application and infrastructure stacks exist, 
firstly any JMX-Enabled or YAMMER-Enabled application can be plugged by configuration. 

***For non-JVM applications or for JVM applications that do not expose JMX MBeans, there is a work in progress to have 
REST Metrics Agent which can receive http put requests and which can be deployed in all scenarios either with or without 
the metrics topic.***

<a name="quick-start">
## Quick-start example with existing Kafka cluster using discovery module and auto-generated dashboard 
</a>

First we need to build the project from source which requires at least `java 1.7` installed on your system:

    ./gradlew build 

There is a docker-compose.yml file that contains grafana, influxdb and kapactior images and a small script
that starts and integrates them together:

    ./docker-instance.sh

Grafana UI should be now exposed at `http://localhost:3000` - under Data Sources tab there should also be one item 
 named 'Kafka Metrics InfluxDB'. The next command will discover all topics the brokers on a local kafka broker 
 by looking into the zookeeper but you can replace the zookeeper connect string with your own:

    ./discovery/build/scripts/discovery --zookeeper "127.0.0.1:2181" --dashboard "my-kafka-cluster" \
        --dashboard-path $PWD/.data/grafana/dashboards --interval 25 \
        --influxdb  "http://root:root@localhost:8086" | ./influxdb-loader/build/scripts/influxdb-loader

The dashboard should be now accessible on this url:

    http://localhost:3000/dashboard/file/my-kafka-cluster.json

For a cluster of 3 brokers it might look like this:
 
![screenshot](doc/discovery-example-3-brokers.png)

<a name="modules-reference">
## Modules Reference
</a>

<a name="usage-discovery">
### Cluster Discovery Tool
</a>

Metrics Discovery tool can be used for generating configs and dashboards for existing Kafka Clusters. It uses
Zookeeper Client and generates Grafana dashboards as json files and configurations for other Kafka Metrics modules
into the STDOUT. The output configuration can be piped into one of the runtime modules, e.g. InfluxDBLoader 
or Metrics Agent. It is a Java Application and first has to be built with the following command:

    ./gradlew :discovery:build

#### Example usage for local Kafka cluster and InfluxDB

    ./discovery/build/scripts/discovery \
        --zookeeper "localhost:2181" \
        --dashboard "local-kafka-cluster" \
        --dashboard-path "./.data/grafana/dashboards" \
        --influxdb "http://root:root@localhost:8086" | ./influxdb-loader/build/scripts/influxdb-loader

The above command discovers all the brokers that are part of the cluster and configures an influxdb-loader
 using local instance of InfluxDB. It also generates a dashboard for the discovered cluster which
 will be stored in the default Kafka Metrics instance.

#### Example usage for remote Kafka cluster with Metrics Agent 

On the Kafka Cluster:

    ./discovery/build/scripts/discovery \
        --zookeeper "<SEED-ZK-HOST>:<ZK-PORT>" \
        --dashboard "remote-kafka-cluster" \
        --topic "metrics" | ./metrics-agent/build/scripts/metrics-agent

On the Kafka Metrics instance:
 
    ./discovery/build/scripts/discovery \
        --zookeeper "<SEED-ZK-HOST>:<ZK-PORT>" \
        --topic "metrics" \
        --dashboard "remote-kafka-cluster" \
        --dashboard-path "./.data/grafana/dashboards" \
        --influxdb "http://root:root@localhost:8086" | ./influxdb-loader/build/scripts/influxdb-loader


<a name="usage-loader">
### InfluxDB Loader Usage
</a>

InfluxDB Loader is a Java application which writes measurements into InfluxDB backend which can be configured
to scan the measurements from any number of JMX ports oand Kafka metrics topics.  
In versions 0.9.+, the topic input functionality is replaced by the Metrics Connect module which utilizes Kafka Connect 
framework. To build an executable jar, run the following command:

    ./gradlew :influxdb-loader:build

Once built, the loader can be launched with `./influxdb-loader/build/scripts/influxdb-loader` by passing it 
path to properties file containing the following configuration:
    - [InfluxDB Configuration](#configuration-influxdb) (required)
    - [JMX Scanner Configuration](#configuration-scanner) (at least one scanner or consumer is required)
    - [Metrics Consumer Configuration](#configuration-consumer) (at least on scanner or consumer is required)

There is a few example config files under `influxdb-loader/conf` which explain how JMX scanners can be added.
If you have a Kafka Broker running locally which has a JMX Server listening on port 19092 and a docker instances of  
InfluxDB and Grafana running locally, you can use the following script and config file to collect the broker metrics:

    ./influxdb-loader/build/scripts/influxdb-loader influxdb-loader/conf/local-jmx.properties

<a name="usage-connect">
### Metrics Connect Usage
</a>

This module builds on Kafka Connect framework. The connector is jar that needs to be first built: 

    ./gradlew :metrics-connect:build

The command above generates a jar that needs to be in the classpath of Kafka Connect which can be achieved
by copying the jar into `libs` directory of the kafka installation:

    cp ./metrics-connect/build/lib/metrics-connect-*.jar $KAFKA_HOME/libs

Now you can launch for example kafka connect standalone connector with the following example configurations:

    "$KAFKA_HOME/bin/connect-standalone.sh" "metrics-connect.properties" "influxdb-sink.properties" "hdfs-sink.properties"

First, `metrics-connect.properties` is the connect worker configuration which doesn't specify any connectors
but says that all connectors will use MeasurementConverter to deserialize measurement objects.

    bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092
    key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
    value.converter=io.amient.kafka.metrics.MeasurementConverter
    ...

The second configuration file is a sink connector that loads the measurements to InfluxDB, for example:

    name=metrics-influxdb-sink
    connector.class=io.amient.kafka.metrics.InfluxDbSinkConnector
    topics=metric
    ...

The third configuration file is a sink connector that loads the measurements to hdfs, for example as parquet files:

    name=metrics-hdfs-sink
    topics=metrics
    connector.class=io.confluent.connect.hdfs.HdfsSinkConnector
    format.class=io.confluent.connect.hdfs.parquet.ParquetFormat
    partitioner.class=io.confluent.connect.hdfs.partitioner.TimeBasedPartitioner
    path.format='d'=YYYY'-'MM'-'dd/
    partition.duration.ms=86400000
    locale=en
    timezone=Etc/GMT+1
    ...

by copying the jar into `libs` directory of the kafka installation:

```

Now you can launch connect instance with the following example configurations:

```
"$KAFKA_HOME/bin/connect-standalone.sh" "metrics-connect.properties" "influxdb-sink.properties" "hdfs-sink.properties"
```

First, `metrics-connect.properties` is the connect worker configuration which doesn't specify any connectors

```
name=metrics-influxdb-sink
connector.class=io.amient.kafka.metrics.InfluxDbSinkConnector
topics=metric
...
```

The thrid configuration file is a sink connector that loads the measurements to hdfs, for example as parquet files:

```
name=metrics-hdfs-sink
topics=metrics
connector.class=io.confluent.connect.hdfs.HdfsSinkConnector
format.class=io.confluent.connect.hdfs.parquet.ParquetFormat

partition.duration.ms=86400000
locale=en

...
```

<a name="metrics-agent">
### Metrics Agent Usage
</a>

The purpose of the agent is to move expensive metrics collection like JMX polling closer to the application and publish
these into the kafka metrics topic. The JMX scanners can be configured in the same way as with InfluxDB Loader except
 the InfluxDB backend connection is replaced with kafka metrics producer which publishes the measurements into a kafka
 topic. It is also a Java application and the executable jar can be built with the following command:  

    ./gradlew :metrics-agent:build

To run the agent instance, a configuration file is required, which should contain the following sections:
     - [JMX Scanner Configuration](#configuration-scanner)
     - [Metrics Producer Configuration](#configuration-producer)

    ./metrics-agent/build/scripts/kafka-metrics-agent <CONFIG-PROPERTIES-FILE>

<a name="usage-reporter">
### Topic Reporter Usage
</a>

The Topic Reporter provides a different way of collecting metrics from Kafka Brokers, Producers, Consumers and Samza
 processors - each of these expose configuration options for plugging a reporter directly into their runtime and the 
 class `io.amient.kafka.metrics.TopicReporter` can be used in either of them. It translates the metrics to kafka metrics
 measurements and publishes them into a topic. 
 
This reporter publishes all the metrics to configured, most often local kafka topic `metrics`. Due to different stage of 
maturity of various kafka components, watch out for subtle differences when adding TopicReporter class. To be able to 
use the reporter as plug-in for kafka brokers and tools you need to put the packaged jar in their classpath, which in 
kafka broker means putting it in the kafka /libs directory:

    ./gradlew install
    cp stream-reporter/lib/stream-reporter-*.jar $KAFKA_HOME/libs/

The reporter only requires one set of configuration properties:
    - [Metrics Producer Configuration](#configuration-producer)


<a name="usage-reporter-kafka-old">
#### Usage in Kafka Broker, Kafka Prism, Kafka Producer (pre 0.8.2), Kafka Consumer (pre 0.9)
</a>


add following properties to the configuration for the component  

    kafka.metrics.reporters=io.amient.kafka.metrics.TopicReporter
    kafka.metrics.<CONFIGURATION-OPTIONS>...

<a name="usage-reporter-kafka-new">
####  Usage in Kafka NEW Producer (0.8.2+) and Consumer (0.9+) 
</a>

    metric.reporters=io.amient.kafka.metrics.TopicReporter
    kafka.metrics.<CONFIGURATION-OPTIONS>...

<a name="usage-reporter-dropwizard">
#### Usage in any application using dropwizard metrics (formerly yammer metrics)
</a>

Like any other yammer metrics reporter, given an instance (and configuration), once started, the reporter
will produce kafka-metrics messages to a configured topic every given time interval. Scala-Maven Example:

``` pom.xml
...
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.amient.kafka.metrics</groupId>
   <artifactId>metrics-reporter</artifactId>
   <version>${kafka.version}</version>
</dependency>
...
```

... Using builder for programmatic initialization

    val registry = MetricsRegistry.defaultRegistry()
    val reporter = TopicReporter.forRegistry(registry)
        .setTopic("metrics") //this is also default
        .setBootstrapServers("kafka1:9092,kafka2:9092")
        .setTag("host", "my-host-xyz")
        .setTag("app", "my-app-name")
        .build()
    reporter.start(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

... OR Using config properties:
 
    val registry = MetricsRegistry.defaultRegistry()
    val config = new java.util.Properties(<CONFIGURATION-OPTIONS>)
    val reporter = TopicReporter.forRegistry(registry).configure(config).build()
    reporter.start(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

<a name="usage-samza">
###  Usage in Samza (0.9+) 
</a>

The InfluxDB Loader and Metrics Connect use the same code which understands json messages that Samza generates 
using MetricsSnapshotSerdeFactory. So just a normal samza metrics configuration without additional code, for example: 

    metrics.reporters=topic
    metrics.reporter.topic.class=org.apache.samza.metrics.reporter.MetricsSnapshotReporterFactory
    metrics.reporter.topic.stream=kafkametrics.metrics
    serializers.registry.metrics.class=org.apache.samza.serializers.MetricsSnapshotSerdeFactory
    systems.kafkametrics.streams.metrics.samza.msg.serde=metrics
    systems.kafkametrics.samza.factory=org.apache.samza.system.kafka.KafkaSystemFactory
    systems.kafkametrics.consumer.zookeeper.connect=<...>
    systems.kafkametrics.producer.bootstrap.servers=<...>

### Issue tracking

https://github.com/amient/kafka-metrics/issues

### Versioning

**Kafka Metrics is closely related to Apache Kafka** and from this perspective it can be viewed as having 2 dimensions:

- *general functionality* - concepts that are available regardless of Kafka version 
- *version-specific functionality* - implementation details that are specific/missing/added in concrete Kafka version

We need this to be able to support variety of real-world setups which may use different Apache Kafka versions in their
infrastructure. For this reason, **we maintain active branches for each version of Apache Kafka project** starting 
from version 0.8.2.1. 

When considering a new general feature, like for example having a first-class 
[collectd integration](https://github.com/amient/kafka-metrics/issues/4), it should be considered how this will work in 
different versions and then design the API appropriately such that it can be easily merged and ported in each active
branch.

Once designed, the general features should be implemented against the `master` branch which is linked to 
the latest official release of Apache Kafka and once this is fully working a pull request against the master can be made.
As part of merging the pull request, the feature must be back-ported to all supported versions.

In case of using a new features of Apache Kafka which are not available in the previous versions actively supported
 by this project, an attempt should be made to design the desired *general functionality* in such way that the older
 version can merge and emulate the missing feature internally. Good example for this is using Kafka Connect features
 in place of InfluxDB Loader that consumes measurement messages from Kafka topic and writes them to InfluxDb. 
 The *general feature* here is to be able to publish measurements into InfluxDB from a Kafka topic. In 0.8.x versions 
 we can use a custom Kafka Consumer (implemented in the core module as MetricsConsumer class) but in 0.9.x+ releases
  we can use a Connector implementation that can be used in a Kafka Connect context. There is a re-design ticket which 
  addresses the point of having the internal API flexible enough to allow for these 2 different ways of implementing it:
  [issues/12](https://github.com/amient/kafka-metrics/issues/12)

**Additional layer of complexity is different versions of InfluxDB.** To keep things simple we are not attempting to 
support multiple versions of InfluxDB protocol and use the latest available. It is possible to support different 
time-series backends but in the world of monitoring there are already a plenty of ways to integrate with InfluxDB so 
for now we keep this option closed unless this becomes an actual pain that cannot be solved otherwise.
